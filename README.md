# Lead Generation Projects

## ðŸ“Œ About

This repository contains a collection of **Lead Generation scripts and notebooks** where I automated workflows for scraping, collecting, and organizing leads from various platforms like **Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Maps, and Events data**. These projects focus on both **cold leadgen** (discovering new prospects) and **warm leadgen** (capturing engaged users).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Automate login and data collection from different platforms.
* Scrape potential leads based on hashtags, post URLs, and engagement.
* Collect business information from Google Maps and LinkedIn.
* Build structured datasets for outreach and campaigns.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, requests)
* **Jupyter Notebooks & .py scripts** for automation
* **Google Maps, Instagram, LinkedIn APIs / scraping**
* **CSV/Excel** for data storage

## ðŸ“Š Project Highlights

* ðŸ“Œ **Instagram Cold Leadgen** â€“ Extracted potential leads by searching hashtags and double hashtags.
* ðŸ“Œ **Instagram Warm Leads** â€“ Scraped users interacting with specific posts (likes/comments).
* ðŸ“Œ **LinkedIn Location-Based Leads** â€“ Collected professional leads filtered by geography.
* ðŸ“Œ **Google Maps Leadgen** â€“ Extracted business names, categories, and contact details.
* ðŸ“Œ **Reels Views Tracker** â€“ Automated reel engagement data extraction.
